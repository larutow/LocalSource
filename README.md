# LocalSource

LocalSource is an e-commerce aggregation platform where users can find products available from local vendors. 

Vendors can quickly and painlessly forward their existing etsy & shopify inventories for greater visibility to their local market **using just their existing store's URL**

## Technologies Leveraged

LocalSource is a full-stack MERN application (**M**ongoDB, **E**xpress, **R**eact, **N**ode).
- API calls are facilitated by axios
- JWT is leveraged for user login/authentication

## Usage

```javascript
//Start API/Backend
cd ls-back
npm start

//Start React frontend server
cd customclient
npm start
```
